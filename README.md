Block 27: Workshop - "Pokemon App"

Create a React app that retrieves and displays a list of pokemon
    • Use the Pokemon API to fetch a list of Pokemon
    • Use pokemonList setPokemonList (instead of mapping)

When you click on a pokemon in the list, it should go to a details page displaying more information about it
    • Create 'onClick' event handler
        • Display detailed information on selected Pokemon
        • Create a new 'back' <button>


Add a form that allows the user to create their own pokemon
